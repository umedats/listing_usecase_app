# SellingPartnerAPIListingSampleApplication

## Introduction

This app demonstrates how to use the APIs listed in [Building Listings Management Workflows Guide](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/building-listings-management-workflows-guide) to construct common listing management workflows using a simple UI. The Selling Partner API (SP-API) is a REST-based API that helps Amazon selling partners programmatically access their data on listings, orders, shipments, payments, etc. The Listings APIs are a subset of the SP-API which allows the users to build listings creation and management workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. This app requires a browser which supports Javascript ES6 (2015).
2. This app requires at least NodeJS 14.18.0, so please install a supported [version](https://nodejs.org/en/).
   1. For Windows and MacOS operating systems, [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run the installer.
   2. For the Unix / Linux operating systems, install through the [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to check out the source code of this app.
   1. For Windows operating system, [download the installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer.
   2. For the MacOS operating system, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run the command `brew install git`.
   3. For the Unix / Linux operating systems, install through the [package manager](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).
4. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
   1. For Windows operating system, [download the installer](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi) and run the installer.
   2. For the MacOS operating system, [download the installer](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg) and run the installer.
   3. For the Unix / Linux operating systems, it takes multiple steps for the installation. Click the [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) and expand the Linux section to view the installation instructions.
5. This app requires an AWS Account for the Notifications workflow and to store the app settings in a secure manner. AWS charges this account if it receives the listing notifications through this app. If you are not already an AWS customer, you can create a [free AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free).
6. This app requires a professional seller or vendor account to integrate with the SP-API. If you do not have a professional seller or vendor account, then create a new seller account. Refer to [Start selling with Amazon](https://sell.amazon.com/).
7. This app requires the credentials of a selling partner application which has access to the [Product Listing role](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/product-listing-role). If you do not have a selling partner application, then [create a new application](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-your-application) by registering as SP-API developer. An SP-API developer can develop a private seller application, private vendor application or public application. Any application works for this app.
8. This app requires the authorization of a seller or vendor account with the above application. Refer to [Authorizing Selling Partner API applications](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/authorizing-selling-partner-api-applications)

### How to run the app

1. Check out the repository to your computer from Git through the command `git clone https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-samples.git`.
2. Open the `selling-partner-api-samples/use-cases/listings/` folder.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the node modules necessary to run the app.
4. Follow the instructions in **Configure the AWS CLI** section to create an IAM user and configure the AWS CLI.
5. Run the command `npm run build` to build the app.

10. Click **Done**.
11. Run the command `aws configure` to [configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html#cli-authentication-user-configure-wizard) to use the access keys from the CSV file. 
12. Delete the csv file which contains the access keys.

## Configure Settings inside the app

Use the settings gear icon to access the settings page. The settings page displays a form to configure the settings with the following fields.

1. **AccountId** : Enter the account Id of the AWS account. This account contains the infrastructure to receive notifications and store app settings. Refer to [View AWS account identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.html) to locate the AWS account ID. Please delete all the subscriptions created through the app when you change the account Id.
2. **Client Id** : Enter the Client Id part of the selling partner application LWA credentials mentioned in the Prerequisites section. Refer to [Viewing your application information and credentials](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/viewing-your-application-information-and-credentials)
3. **Client Secret** : Enter the Client Secret part of the selling partner application LWA credentials mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
4. **Refresh Token** : Enter the refresh token which authorizes the selling partner application to submit SP-API requests. Refer to [Authorizing Selling Partner API applications](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/authorizing-selling-partner-api-applications).
5. **Selling Partner Id Type** : For the seller applications, select "Merchant Account Id". For the vendor applications, select "Vendor Code".
6. **Selling Partner Id** : For the seller applications, enter the [Merchant Token from the Seller central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/account-information/merchant-token). For the vendor applications, enter the vendor code of the selling account.
7. **Marketplace Id** : Enter the marketplaceId of the selling account. Refer to [Marketplace IDs](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids).
8. **Region** : Select the SP-API endpoint AWS region based on your selected marketplaceId. Refer to [SP-API Endpoints](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sp-api-endpoints). The app creates any infrastructure for the notifications workflow in the selected region.

Click the Save button to save the settings into [AWS Secret Manager.](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) The settings page uses the AWS credentials of the above IAM User to persist the settings. If the policies for the above IAM User are incorrect, then the settings page may fail to persist the settings.

## Verify the app runs successfully
